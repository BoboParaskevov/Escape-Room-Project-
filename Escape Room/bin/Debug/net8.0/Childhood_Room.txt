Description: You wake up in your childhood bed confused and drenched with sweat. Disoriented you\nlook around. Everything is just as it was all those years ago. Your wardrobe in which you\nhid all your favorite toys behind the clothes so your parents won’t toss them away. The\nonly things they bought you were those puzzles which would supposedly make you\nsmarter but they even locked them in a chest when you were grounded so  those toys\nwere the most precious thing you had back then. With all those memories flooding back\nyou look at the carpet on which you spent many nights being grounded because of the\nmost silly reasons. Even the glass box in which they put the key to your door that could\nonly be opened with a code for which they even plastered a math equation with the\ncode as the answer just to remind you why you weren’t allowed to exit your room. You\nknew what to do but where was the equation? You were well capable of solving it now/n but it was nowhere to be found.
